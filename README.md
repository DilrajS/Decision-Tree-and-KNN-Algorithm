# Machine Learning Algorithms Learning Repository

This repository contains files provided by UCSD for the purpose of learning and familiarizing yourself with machine learning algorithms. The project files were initially uploaded on January 25, 2021.

## Files

1. **decision-tree.json**: This JSON file contains the serialized representation of the Decision Tree model.

2. **decision-tree.py**: This Python script contains the code related to the Decision Tree algorithm for educational purposes.

3. **knn.json**: This JSON file contains the serialized representation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.

4. **knn.py**: This Python script contains the code related to the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for educational purposes.

## Usage

These files have been provided to you by your teachers at UCSD to help you learn and understand machine learning algorithms. You can use the provided Python scripts to explore the code and algorithms. These files are intended for educational purposes to aid in your understanding of how these algorithms work.

Please note that these files may not be complete production-ready implementations, but they serve as educational materials to help you get started with these algorithms.
